# **JavaUtilities**

A .Net 8.0 library written in C# which provides a wide variety of utilities, many of which are directly derived from similar utilities available in Java. All public members have documentation comments and a Sandcastle Help File Builder script has been included, along with reasonably comprehensive NUnit tests. **This library has not been tested in production. Bugs are to be expected.**
